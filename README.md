# ds-projects

An aggregation of my various completed data analytics/data science projects.
They were uploaded as-is, and as of: 4/4/19
I have not gone back to revise techniques, code, or analyses to create more thorough notebooks. 

The plan is to update each of the incrementally over time with additionally cited resources and more high-level
theory for others to pull and learn from in a holistic fashion

***Update: The Applebees_Capstone_Final.ipynb is mostly current, however, I need to go back and re-parition the data so that the section comparing promtional periods does not throw errors. This comes from me forgetting to re-open/re-name the files post-split.***
