# ds-projects

An aggregation of my various completed data analytics/data science projects.
They were uploaded as-is, and as of: 2/15/19
I have not gone back to revise techniques, code, or analyses to create more thorough notebooks. 

The plan is to update each of the incrementally over time with additionally cited resources and more high-level
theory for others to pull and learn from in a holistic fashion
